Unsupervised topic extraction:
- K-Means clustering or any other sensible clustering algorithm

- Latent Dirichlet Allocation - http://blog.echen.me/2011/08/22/introduction-to-latent-dirichlet-allocation/

General things that I want included
- What about extracting the original insider topic?
1. Bag of words most frequent words chart
2. Frequent words over time
3. Sentiment analysis plus charts (different documents on a chart with their respective sentiments) plus the same 
document (topic, rather) over time
4. Try non-negative matrix factorization?
5. Latent Dirichlet Allocation plus allocation of each document to a topic
6. Charts by topic groups
